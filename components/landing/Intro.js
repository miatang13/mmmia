        I am Mia â€” an MS CS student at Stanford University.
        I am passionate about developing innovative
        creative tools for artists and designers.

        During my time at Carnegie Mellon University, where I received
        Bachelors of Computer Science and Arts, I had the privilege of
        conducting research on generative systems under the guidance of
        Prof.

        Teaching is a passion of mine. I believe in the power of
        visual storytelling as a vessel for knowledge sharing. In my free time,
        I experiment as a comic artist, curating accessible educational
        illustrations on technical topics. I have had the honor to co-teach courses at SIGGRAPH and
        SIGGRAPH Asia on Generative AI, incorporating visual narratives in the teaching material.
