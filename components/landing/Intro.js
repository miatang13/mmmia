          I am Mia ‚Äî a master's student in computer science at Stanford University, advised by Professor  {" "}
          <StyledExternalLink href="https://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/"> Maneesh Agrawala</StyledExternalLink>.
          Previously, I earned my BCSA (Bachelor of Computer Science and Arts) at Carnegie Mellon University,
          where I was fortunate to be advised by Professor <StyledExternalLink href='https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~junyanz/'>
            Jun-Yan Zhu
          </StyledExternalLink> on generative visual systems and Professor <StyledExternalLink href='https://kyuhashim.com/'>
            Kyuha Shim
          </StyledExternalLink> on computational design.<br /><br />

          My research interests are at the intersection of computer graphics, computational 2D and 3D design, and storytelling.
          I am interested in leveraging generative models to create visual content and tools.<br /><br />

          I am passionate about teaching and express this through my work as a comic artist,
          developing accessible educational illustrations on technical topics. In my free time, I volunteer as a math tutor for preschool children at local schools in Palo Alto.

          <br /><br />
