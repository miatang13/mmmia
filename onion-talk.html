                <p>In total we received 50 reponses for our digital survey. We affirmed the 
                    fact that students are not very satisfied with the course selecting and dropping 
                    process, with the observation that students mainly dropped out due to the unmanageable 
                    workload. Even though our team thought that the main reason for the students’ 
                    dissatisfaction were due to misinformation on the syllabus, the survey concluded 
                    that syllabi are in fact very accurate, and that students did not know about the 
                    courses enough before registering for them. </p>

                    or she could click through various categories to get an idea of the course.
                    We observed which categories, in which order, each participant clicked 
                    so that we could learn what his intuitive interests are.

                rate should be more visible, and students should feel comfortable communicating

            <p> OnionTalk is approachable and understanding to students because 
                of its ability to post, read, and search anonymously. The anonymity 
                in posting honest feedback in the discussion boards is helpful to 
                students because it gives personal experience about the course, 
                professors, workload and difficulty by the students. The discussion 
                board is written by the students for the students.</p>
