            <p>In total we received 50 reponses for our digital survey. We affirmed the 
                fact that students are not very satisfied with the course selecting and dropping 
                process, with the observation that students mainly dropped out due to the unmanageable 
                workload. Even though our team thought that the main reason for the students’ 
                dissatisfaction were due to misinformation on the syllabus, the survey concluded 
                that syllabi are in fact very accurate, and that students did not know about the 
                courses enough before registering for them. </p>

            <p> For the in-person interviews, the main purpose was to specifically ask and talk 
                about students’ past experience with dropping courses and to better understand 
                their standards when course selecting. Through hearing their testimonies, our 
                group could understand the main roots of what is working and not working in different

                    unrealistic, true or fabricated info about a course. The participant 
                    was given that he or she is considering taking this course, and he 
                    or she could click through various categories to get an idea of the course.
                    We observed which categories, in which order, each participant clicked 
                    so that we could learn what his intuitive interests are.

                We concluded that essential information of the course should be kept, emotional 
                aspects from past students should be included, the amount of workload and dropout
                rate should be more visible, and students should feel comfortable communicating
