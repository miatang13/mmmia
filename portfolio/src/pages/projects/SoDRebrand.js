              see themselves in the design field. In order to be accessible and
              convincing to the highschool students, a more playful brand
              identity needed to be established.

              To inspire those potential future designers to apply for CMU, we

                educate, motivate, and connect

              . It is only possible for highschool students to apply if only
              they are motivated to become designers, so in the series of

              <span className="highlight_text"> website, print, marketing</span>
              , we strive to provide insights on how the audience just might be

          We created a cheerful, young and exciting visual identity with the

            As the lead developer on the team, I first researched on the
            existing popular CMS on the market, and decided on using Cargo to
            make our website come to life. By using a CMS, it allows easy

              This project was fun from the very start as I got to work with
              some of my favorite classmates as colleagues and professors as
              mentors and clients, and furthermore, I am more than honored to be
              chosen to be part of the effort to rebrand and promote CMU SoD.{" "}
              <br /> <br /> Professor Brett Yasko and Professor Dylan Vitone
              gave us valuable feedback and inspirations throughout the project
              as our main point of contact with the SoD faculty. Their
              continuous support and guidance allowed our creativity to flourish
              and be executed.

              This was my first time working on a client project focusing on
              creating a completely new brand identity, and developing separate
              projects across different mediums to achieve the objective. The
              technical aspect of this project was not too challenging, but I
              still learned a lot about working with CMS, <q>hacking</q> the
              pre-defined rules, and using custom code to enable playful
              interactions.
              <br />
              <br />
              As a conclusion, I have been very grateful to be a part of this
              project, and it had helped me grow both as a designer and as a
              developer.
