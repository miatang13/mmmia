              For ideation, each student made a Bitsy prototype of a specific
              narrative game they were interested in creating. Then people split
              into groups to develop a popular concept they were all interested
              in. <br /> <br />
              Anne He, Ameer Jones and I teamed up to turn Anne's concept into
              an actual game, which is a witty and thought-provoking narrative
              that involves user exploring the world as a little salmon. The
              journey of swimming up stream hints at the mentality of chasing
              the crowd, revealing a deeper question under the disguise of an
              innocent fish game.

              Before moving into Unity, we further explored the narrative design
              by creating a Narrative Design Sketch. Together we strengthened
              the plot by adding more interactive characters the player can
              engage with. <br />
              <br />
              Throughout the process, we stayed mindful of the assets we needed
              to create with each potential feature we were considering by
              keeping track of the Game Design Macro spreadsheet.

              One interesting exercise in the planning process was the Color

              to visualize and solidify our visions of the game as a team.

          actual game along with great teammates and mentor. <br />
          <br />
          As both a game designer and game developer, I was glad to explore and
          sharpen my skills in both areas. In particular, I grew interested in a
          technical artist's role in game development, but I also greatly
          appreciate how game developer holds the power to make the game
          playable.
