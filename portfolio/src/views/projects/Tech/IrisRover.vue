        <p class="body__text">
          IrisRover is being built by Carnegie Mellon Students led by Professor
          Red Whittaker along with Astrobotic and NASA. It is a light-weight
          lunar rover of 4.4 lbs. (two kilograms) originally called CubeRover.
          <br />
          <br />
          Starting from December 2019, I have been working as 1 of the 4
          frontend developers on the UI-development team for IrisRover, creating
          usable interfaces for mission officers to utilize when our rover lands
          on the moon.

          For IrisRover, UI Dev is at the center of Database, Render processes,
          Ground Commands, and Rover Data. Essentially, after we launch the
          rover, a working interface determines if we can achieve our end goal,
          taking photos of the moon.

        <p class="body__text">
          The specific interface I have been working on is the Telemetry
          interface, where the data we receive from the rover is analyzed and
          displayed. We use Vue.js as our main framework, and of course, HTML &
          SCSS for markdowns and stylings.
