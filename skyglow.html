                    The hardest part of this was to consider some special cases 
                    that will only occur in a computer simulated world where the 
                    time is not continuous but discrete. This led me to realize 
                    how sometimes some approximation should be creatively used in 
                    order to avoid solving complicated equations and to improve performance.  </p>
