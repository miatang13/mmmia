            <h4>A Little Something Something About Me.</h4>
            <br>
            <p> Born in China <br> Raised in Vancouver, B.C., Canada <br> Have 2 corgis</p>
            <br>
            <h4>More Professional Stuff.</h4>
            <br>
            <p > I enjoy problem-solving through various mediums, and am 
                    always up for learning and challenging myself.<br><br>
                    Being at a tech-oriented university, I realized my curiosity of 
                    Computer Science and Mathematical Logic, which goes hand-in-hand
                    with my passion for design.<br><br>
                    It allows me to implement my own designs, thus being a truly
                    end-to-end designer, carrying ideas from initial user research
                    all the way to front-end engineering.</p>
